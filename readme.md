# TWILA Whispers Ideas Lyrically & Aesthetically.
黄昏女孩如诗般唯美地低语着灵感。

This is a blog project by Will Xu, built using the HTMX and Flask frameworks. To get started, you will need to set up the following:

1. Install the required Python dependencies as specified in app.py based on your system.
2. Set up a PostgreSQL instance to run on the same server as the project.
3. Create a .env file in the root directory of the project, where you will store the database-related information, especially modifying the password.
4. Before running init_database.sql, make sure to update the password in the script to match the one set in the .env file.
5. Afterward, run the init_database.sql script in PostgreSQL.
6. Once everything is set up, you can simply run run.sh file to start the application.
